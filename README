This project runs on Alloy and requires a little work before firing it up (because I didn't want to add huge files to the Git repo).

Steps to get set up:

(1) Import the project to Titanium Studio 
(2) Add a folder named "Resources" at the root of the project
(3) Inside of the project directory, run the command "alloy compile"
(4) Do as you will

Currently tested on TIMOB 2.1.3GA, iPhone-only (6.X).

Here's a screenshot of the app: https://raw.github.com/mcongrove/SAR-Assist/master/screenshot.png

Because it's unrealistic to drive 10-20 miles to demo this unit, it utilizes FAKE DATA INPUT! You can see where this occurs as the bottom of the "home.js" controller.

Please follow these steps to demo the application:

(1) Open the application, it will place you in Melbourne, FL facing north-east
(2) Select the following options: LOW, 10MI
(3) Press MARK
(4) The app will calculate your next waypoint (which you can add to the Denso unit by clicking ADD TO GPS)
(5) The app will now place you 10 miles north-east, facing north, just a little bit south of the waypoint
(6) Select the following options: MED, 1MI
(7) Press MARK
(8) The app will calculate your next waypoint (which you can add to the Denso unit by clicking ADD TO GPS)
(9) The app recognizes you have enough data to determine the distress signal location, about 2 miles north of your current position; it shows the location coordinates
(10) Press "PROCEED TO ELT" to load the location of the distress signal into your GPS
