This project runs on Alloy and requires a little work before firing it up (because I didn't want to add huge files to the Git repo).

Steps to get set up:

(1) Import the project to Titanium Studio 
(2) Add a folder named "Resources" at the root of the project
(3) Inside of the project directory, run the command "alloy compile"
(4) Do as you will

Currently tested on TIMOB 2.1.3GA, iPhone-only (6.X).

Here's a lovely PowerPoint (saved as images): http://www.codeblog.co/denso/index.html

Because it's unrealistic to drive 10-20 miles to demo this unit, it utilizes FAKE DATA INPUT! You can see where this occurs as the bottom of the "main.js" controller.

Please follow these steps to demo the application:

(1) Open the application, it will place you in Melbourne, FL facing north-east; click on the + button to take a measurement
(2) Select the following options: LOW, 5MI
(3) Press the MARK LOCATION & BEARING button
(4) The app will calculate your next waypoint and place a yellow marker (which you can add to the Denso unit by selecting the annotation and clicking the + button)
(5) The app will now place you 10 miles north-east, facing north, just a little bit south of the waypoint; click on the + button to take another measurement
(6) Select the following options: MED, 10MI
(7) Press the MARK LOCATION & BEARING button
(8) The app will calculate your next waypoint and place a yellow marker (which you can add to the Denso unit by selecting the annotation and clicking the + button)
(9) The app recognizes you have enough data to determine the distress signal location, about 2 miles north of your current position; it shows the location coordinates
(10) Click on the red exclamation marker and click on the + button to add the ELT location to your Denso unit
